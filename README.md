### Note: -
  1. Please download Glove word vector (50d) file from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ .
  2. The file path provided for Glove vector, training model and saved model file is relative and hence the files should be put in the appropriate directory.
  3. The hyper-parameters used are self-explanatory in the code.
